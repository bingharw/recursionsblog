            	<p><q>You’ve met with a terrible fate, haven’t you?</q><span class="ref_num">1</span> <span class="line_test"> This question stops the </span> player in their tracks towards the beginning of <cite>Majora’s Mask</cite>. Accompanied by the high-pitched laughter of the Mask Salesman, it subsequently reappears with the apocalyptic animation that plays whenever the timer runs out on the <q>Night of the Final Day</q>. What we might call the <em>procedural recurrence</em> of this question—the fact that it is programmed into the game’s "fail state"—seems to prioritise the theme of predetermination. With every “game over”, the player is made to reconsider the limits of their agency.</p>

            	<p>Yet fate is not a straightforward concept in <cite>Majora</cite>. For one thing, the procedural recurrence of the Mask Salesman’s dialogue is undermined by the experience of playing the game. After reclaiming the Ocarina of Time, the player is never in a position when they cannot use it to <q>Save and return to the Dawn of the First Day</q>. If they ever encounter the fail state, they do so out of curiosity, allowing the moon to crash into Termina. This subverts the implied alignment of the player’s experience with that of their avatar. We let the Boy meet a terrible fate.</p>

            	<p>Further complications arise when comparing Bill Trinen’s English translation to the Japanese text. The original line is <q>大変な目にあいましたねえ･･･</q>.<span class="ref_num">2</span> This is literally, <q>you’ve really met an eye</q>, but more commonly, <q>you’ve had a terrible experience</q>. The “eye” in question, 目, <i>me</i>, refers to a spot on a side of a die, the “experience” of chance. Here, any “fate” connotes contingency, rather than predestination. Jim can therefore use similar phrasing to describe the rough experience the Bombers Secret Society of Justice had after admitting the Skull Kid.</p>

            	<p>Setting aside procedural recurrence, <cite>Majora</cite> stores four mentions of “fate” in read-only memory, two being separate instances of the “terrible fate” phrase. The remaining two mentions are the Owl wandering whether the Boy has the <q>strength</q> to <q>change the fate of this land</q> and the <q>courage</q> to <q>change the fate</q> of Snowhead. Earlier, the Owl substitutes “destiny” for “fate”, asking if the Boy has <q>the power to change the destiny of this land</q> and speaking of the Southern Swamp as <q>destined to fade</q>. In both cases, the original Japanese is one word: 運命, <i>unmei</i>.</p>

				<p>In Trinen’s translation of <cite>Majora</cite>, friction emerges between this concept of unmei and convectional understandings of “destiny” in the fantasy genre. As Farah Mendlesohn writes, “portal-quest” narratives are often “destinarian”: an individual enters a mysterious, fantastical world, gradually learning “enough to change it and to enter into that world’s destiny”.<span class="ref_num">5</span>  In such narratives, destiny offers a “rational explanation of irrational action without destroying the mystery” of the fantasy world. <cite>Majora</cite>’s “prequel”, <cite>Ocarina of Time</cite>, overtly reproduces this destinarian rationality. In <cite>Ocarina</cite>, characters use unmei to refer to the Boy’s preordained role as the “Hero of Time”.<span class="ref_num">6</span> However, the dialogue also uses 宿命, <i>shukumei</i>, a word that more readily connotes predestination and one entirely absent from <cite>Majora</cite>.</p>

				<p>Trinen inserts a reference to <cite>Ocarina</cite>’s destinarian rationality at the beginning of Majora. We learn that the Boy <q>finally fulfilled his heroic destiny and took his place among legends</q>. This “heroic destiny” is not mentioned in the Japanese text, which only refers to the Boy’s 冒険, <i>bōken</i>, his “adventure”. Elsewhere, mentions of unmei in <cite>Majora</cite> are grounded in place/nature, rather than individual heroism. In his parting song, Mikau describes being destined to disappear into sea foam;  Shikashi, meanwhile, speaks of sharing the fate of the land (the Trinen translation introduces a notion of "cosmic design" here).  Without the “terrible fate” line, there is no explicit mention of the Boy’s unmei.</p>

			</aside>
			<p>Following Caroline Webb, it can perhaps be countered that the Boy’s “destiny” still functions through the “expected outcomes” of the fantasy genre.<span class=ref_num>7</span> Here, the player understands individual destiny to be at play without it being mentioned.  The Owl’s very presence and his insistence on the Boy’s “courage” allude to Ocarina’s particular cosmology set certain destinarian expectations. However, the conventional outcomes of the portal-quest fantasy do not arrive. The Boy does not discover his preordained role within Termina society. Other than through the subterfuge of masks, he remains an outsider to the end, altering the land’s unmei without sharing in it.</p>

			<p>So, what is the Boy’s unmei? I don’t mean to dismiss Trinen’s “terrible fate” line for “mistranslating the original”. However, I am interested in how de-emphasising a certain reading of fate can highlight interesting alternatives. Rather than heroic destiny, we have unmei in the sense given by twentieth-century philosopher Kuki Shūzō. Here, a contingency, something possible but not necessary, has become necessary by manifesting in/as the present.<span class="ref_num">8</span> Unmei is not the plan of heavenly actors but rather "internalised contingency", an unexpected occurrence that reveals our existence as “bound in time” itself.<span class="ref_num">9</span> The Boy was not predestined to save Termina, but, as things turned out, it was his “fate” to be there.</p>

			</aside>
			<p>In short, we can read the Mask Salesman’s observation about “terrible fate” as referring not to heroic destiny but the unmei of a “chance encounter between two entities”.<span class="ref_num">10</span> This reading of fate as unmei rather than heroic destiny lends weight to the curious interplay of necessity and contingency in the Mask Salesman’s parting words: “Whenever there is a meeting, a parting is sure to follow. However, that parting need not last forever...” To interpret this further will require examining how the <cite>Majora</cite>’s mechanic of replaying the same “three days” complicates the themes of unmei suggested in the dialogue. That will be work for a future blog. </p>
